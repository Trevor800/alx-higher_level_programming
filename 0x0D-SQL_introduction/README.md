That is how you write an SQL query
0x0D-SQL_introduction
SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to store, retrieve, update, and delete data.

Relational databases organize data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. SQL allows you to perform various operations on these tables, such as creating and modifying database structures, querying data, and managing relationships between tables.

SQL is a declarative language, meaning that you specify what you want to retrieve or modify, and the database management system (DBMS) takes care of how to accomplish it. This makes SQL a user-friendly language, as you don't need to worry about the implementation details.
